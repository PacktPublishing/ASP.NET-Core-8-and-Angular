## About the book

If you want to learn how to use ASP.NET Core with Angular effectively, this hands-on guide is for you.

Improve the way you create, debug, and deploy web applications while keeping up to date with the latest developments in .NET 8 and modern Angular, including .NET Minimal APIs and the new Angular standalone API defaults.

You’ll begin by setting up SQL Server 2022 and building a data model with Entity Framework Core. You’ll progress to fetching and displaying data, handling user input with Angular reactive forms, and implementing front-end and back-end validators for maximum effect. After that, you will perform advanced debugging and explore unit testing features with xUnit for .NET, and Jasmine and Karma for Angular. You’ll use Identity API endpoints in ASP.NET Core and functional route guards in Angular to add authentication and authorization to your apps. Finally, you’ll learn how to deploy to Windows, Linux, and Azure.

By the end of this book, you will understand how to tie together the front-end and back-end to build and deploy secure and robust web applications.
